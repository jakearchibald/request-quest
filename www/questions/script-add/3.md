Yep! Looking at [the spec](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/scripting-1.html#dfnReturnLink-0) again:

> When a script element … experiences one of the events listed … the user agent must synchronously prepare the script element (when) the script element gets inserted into a document…

The script preparation is synchronous, it shouldn't wait for layout or the end of execution.
